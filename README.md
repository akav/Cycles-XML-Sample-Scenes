"# Cycles-XML-Sample-Scenes" 

As it helps to have some really simple test cases to run with Cycles standalone and for comparison with the SU2Cycles exporter, I will be continually adding more and more XML samples.

The goal will be to start with really simple test cases such as geometry, lights, camera placement. The goal is to gradually increase scene complexity during export and determine if there are any deficiencies that need to be taken care of.

If you have any suggestions for test cases which you would like to see added to this repo, please reach out to me via email (akavassis@gmail.com)
